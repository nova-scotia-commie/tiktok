The language "JavaScript" was originally called "LiveScript" and was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 for the Netscape 2 browser. In 1997 ownership of JavaScript was handed over to the European Computer Manufacture's Association (ECMA).

Core JavaScript is based on a standard called ECMAScript or ES, for short. In recent years there has been an official update to the standard every year. In 2015, there was a large update to the standard. This was the 6th major version of JavaScript and was called ES6. It added a LOT of new features to the language. Sometimes ES6 it is called ES2015. There have been updates every year since then.
